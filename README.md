## Introduction

NourishConnect seeks to tackle two major global issues: food waste and hunger. Every day, tons of food are wasted at various establishments while millions of people are struggling with hunger. NourishConnect’s mission is to create a direct connection between those who have surplus food and those in need.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem: Food Waste and Hunger

- "Every day, tons of food are wasted at restaurants, hotels, and events."
- "Meanwhile, millions of people go hungry."

This problem is exacerbated by the lack of systems that can connect those with surplus food to individuals or organizations in need.
